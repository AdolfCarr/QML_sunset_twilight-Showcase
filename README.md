# Sunset and Twilight using QT QML

## Project Description
This project is a Qt QML application titled "Sunset-Twilight" that simulates a dynamic sunset and twilight scene with various animated elements. Here's a brief description:


 - **Window Setup**:
The main window has a fixed size of 1400x700 pixels and displays the title "Sunset-Twilight."

 - **Background and Sky**:
A Rectangle named sky serves as the background, changing color in a continuous loop to simulate the transition from indigo to light blue and back.
 
 - **Mountain and Sea**:
An Image of mountains is placed at the bottom of the window.
A Rectangle with a gradient simulates the sea, with its colors animated to change gradually, creating a moving effect.

 - **Sun**:
A Rectangle represents the sun, which scales and changes color in a cyclical animation, while also moving up and down.

 - **Clouds**:
Multiple Cloud items are animated with different properties. They scale, rotate, and move in various patterns. One cloud (cloud2) changes its parent when clicked.
 
 - **Moon and Stars**:
An Image of the moon moves across the screen and triggers the creation and removal of star objects. The moon's movement is animated with a spring behavior, and stars are generated randomly when the moon reaches certain positions.
 
 - **Animations**:
Various animations are applied to elements, including color transitions, scaling effects, and movements. The animations use different easing types and durations to create a smooth and engaging visual experience.
The project aims to create a visually appealing and interactive representation of a sunset and twilight scene using QML's powerful animation capabilities.
